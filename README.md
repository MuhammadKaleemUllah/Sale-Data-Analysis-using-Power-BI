# Sales Data Analysis using Power BI


## Descriptions
This dashboard helps analyze sales for the current year, previous year, and year-over-year (YoY) sales for the given dataset.

Additionally, this dashboard analyzes sales with respect to products and provides information about the sales amount of products in various categories
## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I learned how to use DAX formulas such as CALCULATE, SUM, SUMX, and many more. These formulas were crucial in performing complex calculations and aggregations needed for the analysis.

One of the main challenges was creating visualizations that were easy to understand for all users. To address this, I employed a variety of visualization types, including:

- Line Chart
- Stacked Area Chart
- Scatter Chart
- Matrix
- Line Chart for Forecasting Sales
- Slicers for Selecting Year to Analyze

These visualizations helped present the data in a clear and accessible manner, making it easier for users to analyze the sales data effectively.
